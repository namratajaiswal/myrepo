 * Given three arrays sorted in non-decreasing order, print all common elements in these arrays.

Examples:

ar1[] = {1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80}
ar2[] = {6, 7, 20, 80, 100}
ar3[] = {3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120}
Output: 20, 80

ar1[] = {1, 5, 5}
ar2[] = {3, 4, 5, 5, 10}
ar3[] = {5, 5, 10, 20}
Output: 5, 5

A simple solution is to first find intersection of two arrays and store the intersection in a temporary array, then find the intersection of third array and temporary array. Time complexity of this solution is O(n1 + n2 + n3) where n1, n2 and n3 are sizes of ar1[], ar2[] and ar3[] respectively.

The above solution requires extra space and two loops, we can find the common elements using a single loop and without extra space. The idea is similar to intersection of two arrays. Like two arrays loop, we run a loop and traverse three arrays.
Let the current element traversed in ar1[] be x, in ar2[] be y and in ar3[] be z. We can have following cases inside the loop.
1) If x, y and z are same, we can simply print any of them as common element and move ahead in all three arrays.

2) Else If x < y, we can move ahead in ar1[] as x cannot be a common element.


3) Else If y and y > z), we can simply move ahead in ar3[] as z cannot be a common element.

Following are implementations of the above idea.

public class _28_CommonElementIn3SortedArray_IMP_3 
{ 
	// This function prints common elements in ar1 
	void findCommon(int ar1[], int ar2[], int ar3[]) 
	{ 
		// Initialize starting indexes for ar1[], ar2[] and ar3[] 
		int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0; 

		// Iterate through three arrays while all arrays have elements 
		while (i < ar1.length && j < ar2.length && k < ar3.length) 
		{ 
			// If x = y and y = z, print any of them and move ahead 
			// in all arrays 
			if (ar1[i] == ar2[j] && ar2[j] == ar3[k]) 
			{ System.out.print(ar1[i]+" "); i++; j++; k++; } 

			// x < y 
			else if (ar1[i] < ar2[j]) 
				i++; 

			// y < z 
			else if (ar2[j] < ar3[k]) 
				j++; 

			// We reach here when x > y and z < y, i.e., z is smallest 
			else
				k++; 
		}

		int ar2[] = {6, 7, 20, 80, 100}; 
		int ar3[] = {3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120}; 

		System.out.print("Common elements are ");
