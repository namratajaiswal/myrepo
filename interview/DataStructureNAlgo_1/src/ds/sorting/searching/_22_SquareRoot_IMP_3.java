 * Algorithm:
1) Start with ‘start’ = 0, end = ‘x’,
2) Do following while ‘start’ is smaller than or equal to ‘end’.
      a) Compute ‘mid’ as (start + end)/2
      b) compare mid*mid with x.
      c) If x is equal to mid*mid, return mid.
      d) If x is greater, do binary search between mid+1 and end. In this case, we also update ans (Note that we need floor).
      e) If x is smaller, do binary search between start and mid

Below is the implementation of above idea.
