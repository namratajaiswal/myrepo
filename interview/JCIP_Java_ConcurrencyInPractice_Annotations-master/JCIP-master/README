This project mirrors the Java concurrency annotations source code as
described in Brian Goetz's Java Concurrency In Practice. The original
can be downloaded from:

http://www.javaconcurrencyinpractice.com/jcip-annotations-src.jar

The four annotations provided are:
	@Immutable
	@ThreadSafe
	@NotThreadSafe
	@GuardedBy

This library -- along with the source and javadoc jar files -- is also
available as a Maven artifact. To use it, add the following dependency
to your pom.xml:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>net.jcip</groupId>
      <artifactId>jcip-annotations</artifactId>
      <version>1.2</version>
      <scope>compile</scope>
    </dependency>

You will also need to add the following repository:
  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <name>eluctari.com</name>
      <id>eluctari</id>
      <url>http://eluctari.s3.amazonaws.com/repo/maven/3</url>
